## Todo

### Non functional features
- parsing can 'consume' tokens and error
- string constant duplication fixed

### Language Features
- function args
    - tuple
- in repl, single variable statements i.e. >>x should return that value
- blocks are their own thing i.e. `do end` because right now theyre built in to if's
- module system
- loops
- lists/slices
- arguments
- JIT
- error handling
    - stack traces
    - print error locations
- sandboxing

## Bugs
- Can't seem to have multiple symbols in repl
